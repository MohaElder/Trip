## Brief

"Let's Plan A Trip" is a trip planner that **focuses on planning the trip**. Unlike most other trip planning apps that emphasizes on route planning, providing you a fancy map and charging you for exporting their route into Google Maps, Let's Plan A Trip's goal is to really help you plan a trip by providing you a variety of handy tools that I the author use to plan my trips in a elegant and neat format.

and it's **free**~

## How Does Let's Plan A Trip help with trip planning

Let's Plan A Trip is a **Note Oriented planning app**. When planning a trip, you start with writing stuff on notes(s): places that you want to visit, things that you would like to do, visa concerns, etc.

Once you get some ideas for your trip, you can start planning by creating **trip segments**. The purpose of trip segment is to better organize your trip plan by splitting portions of them into segments. If you are planning a trip less than a week, you probably just need one segment that has been automatically created for you. But if you are planning some grand trips(like a 1 month road trip to Alaska), you will find splitting the trip into segments really convienient when planning(and when looking at it).

Plus, Let's Plan A Trip has a pretty good Calendar:
